          <>
            YouSUI team has accumulated various experiences by launching various M2E, T2E, Social-Fi, Game-Fi, and DEX
            and NFT Marketplaces as Incubators and Developers. There were tens of thousands of people in the communities
            of various projects and most users of the projects were not able to participate in Private Sale or IDO
            Launchpad. Even early adopters could not easily participate in other Launchpad platforms, and demanded new
            Launchpad platforms suitable for the Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese markets.
            <b>
              {' '}
              We especially felt the need for customized Launchpads in these markets and wanted to have a high market
              share in the relatively new Layer 1 SUI Network.
            </b>{' '}
            So, we are going to provide users with opportunities to invest High Quality Projects such as INO, IDO, and
            IGO Launchpad for the convenience of users. We are focusing on projects that we are incubating or developed
            in the future on SUI Network.

          <>
            YouSUI plans to induce users to use all functions within one platform by adding Launchpad, DEX, Bridge, and
            NFT Marketplace so that SUI Network can be widely used in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam and become familiar with
            users. In addition, it will be a platform that educates users to deep-dive into SUI so that YouSUI and SUI
            Network can become the strongest platform and blockchain in the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese markets at
            the same time.Through the localization strategy, we will support developmental support and incubation
            programs so that more developers and project builders can use YouSUI and SUI Network. We will support the
            Incubation Program and Migration Program so that other Layer 1 projects can migrate to the SUI Network and
            succeed.

The blockchain utilizes a process called “transaction parallelization” to achieve that, which allows transaction processing in “parallel agreement.” This “horizontal scaling,” as Sui dubs it, leads to better data organization in the byzantine fault-tolerant proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.',

It abstracts the traditional blockchain model into uncorrelated transaction flows that nodes can validate individually.',

          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Ensuring Liquidity and Lockup: <br />
            At YouSUI, investor security is paramount. Projects must contribute a minimum of $400–500k to the liquidity
            pool, locked for 12 months. Non-compliant projects risk their raised tokens being retained in stable coins,
            protecting investors from potential losses.
          </>,
          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Timely Listing and Investor Choice:
            <br />
            YouSUI maintains accountability and transparency by enforcing a maximum one-month gap between the IDO and
            listing date. If this timeline is exceeded, the community participates in a poll to decide whether to
            continue with the project or issue a full refund.
          </>,
          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Price Stability and Refunds:
            <br />
            Price volatility is a concern, especially in the early stages. YouSUI requires projects to stay above the
            IDO price until 50% of tokens are distributed to the community. Falling below the IDO price for a week
            qualifies investors for a refund, reducing the risk of early token price drops.
          </>,
          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Simultaneous Distribution for Fairness:
            <br />
            To ensure fairness, YouSUI verifies distribution times among all parties involved. All participants receive
            distributions simultaneously. Non-compliance may result in penalties or refunds, promoting equal
            opportunities for all investors.
          </>,
          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Full Token Delivery and Vesting:
            <br />
            YouSUI emphasizes transparency by requiring projects to deliver full token amounts before launch. However,
            prior vesting contracts with agreed-upon distribution dates are allowed, with YouSUI verifying their
            immutability.
          </>,
          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Secure Funds Management:
            <br />
            YouSUI takes a responsible approach to funds management. Raised funds during IDOs or from VCs are held in a
            secure vault, safeguarding against rug pulls or failures caused by incompetent management.
          </>,
          <>
            <IconSquareCheck /> Smart Contract Audits and Token Restrictions:
            <br />
            YouSUI prioritizes the integrity of project smart contracts. Thorough audits are conducted to ensure no
            blacklisting or restrictions that harm token distribution and the community.

          'one of the most community-dedicated launchpads, YouSUI has always been committed to protecting users and prioritized the safety of their investments from day one. One of our key differentiators is a more thorough due diligence of all projects that considers various project aspects, including regulatory, legal, financial, technology, and business capabilities.',
          'Despite our very selective process, we have faced a range of issues with some of the projects that unfavorably affected the investments of our community and the credibility of our platform, including a delayed launch, insufficient marketing on the project’s end, postponed token distribution, and others. To avoid these problems in the future and protect our users, YouSUI will apply new regulations based on the last 2-month research completed by our team and extensive experience in launches of a number of projects.',
          'To adhere to our mission to bring only top-quality IDOs to the attention of our community, YouSUI has formulated a list of new IDO rules that will apply to all projects that would like to complete the IDO on our launchpad starting May 1, 2022. These regulations will also benefit projects as they will guide them on how to prepare for the IDO more comprehensively to ensure their success, as well as high returns for their investors. All selected projects will receive multifaceted support in marketing, tokenomics advisory, launch strategies, and more from our team.',

          'YouSUI won’t accept projects with unreasonable valuations (FDV) or where multiples between the seed and the public rounds are more than 5x.',
          'YouSUI will not participate in project launches if there are more than 4–5 launchpads participating in the project public launch and will limit projects launching on our platform to around $1M in public raise unless there are exceptional reasons to justify a larger raise.',
          'YouSUI will review more carefully the project cap table to avoid known dumpers as well as MM’s and Exchanges in order to make sure the best results for the project.',
          'YouSUI will review carefully the project roadmap and budgeting both from development and marketing aspects and will make sure the plan is feasible and the project is dedicating enough funds for at least a 2 years runway.',
          'YouSUI will require a minimum amount of $400–500k to be added to the liquidity pool (proportional to the amount raised) and locked for at least 12 months. In case a project would choose to not respect this rule, YouSUI will have the right to keep the raised amount of tokens in stable coins in order to protect its community.',
          'YouSUI will require at max 1 month between the IDO and listing date (TGE). In cases where 1 month is exceeded, the community will be offered to participate in a poll to decide whether we should continue with the project or do a full refund.',
          'YouSUI will require projects to stay above the IDO price until at least 50% of tokens were distributed to the community from the public sale. This is mandatory for all projects in all market conditions. If a project falls below the IDO price before 50% is distributed and stays below the IDO price for at least a week, then it will be considered as a legit reason for a refund of all further distributions.',
          'Due to multiple issues where other launchpads got tokens prior to our community, we will enforce that all projects will verify the distribution times of all parties. Everyone will get the distributions at the same time or else they will suffer a substantial financial penalty or full refund or partial refund of all future distributions.',
          'YouSUI will require from projects full amounts of tokens before their launch. Unless the project has created a prior vesting contract with entire token amounts to be distributed on specific agreed dates which will be verified so it can’t be changed later.',
          'As a launchpad YouSUI will send the funds collected from the public IDO or VC deals only according to the vesting schedule. In other words, we will no longer release the funds at the TGE. YouSUI will hold raised amounts for refunds at a safe vault in case of rug pools or any other critical failure caused directly or indirectly by incompetent management of the company.',
          'YouSUI will review the project’s smart contract audits and verify there are no blacklisting or other restrictions in their token contract so it doesn’t hurt token distribution and the community.',
